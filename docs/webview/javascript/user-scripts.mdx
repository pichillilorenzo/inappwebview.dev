What is a User Script? We can say that the `UserScript` class is the equivalent of the [WKUserScript](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkuserscript) iOS native class.
It represents a JavaScript code that the WebView injects into the web page and in any other subsequent navigated web page.

What are the advantages of using User Scripts instead of just injecting some JavaScript code with, for example, the `evaluateJavascript` method?
An `UserScript` gives you the possibility to inject a JavaScript code before other resources of the web page are loaded, setting the `injectionTime` property, for example, to `UserScriptInjectionTime.AT_DOCUMENT_START` (that is the equivalent of the `WKUserScriptInjectionTime.atDocumentStart` iOS native property).

For each `UserScript`, you can set an optional [Content World](/docs/webview/javascript/content-worlds/), set whether to inject the script into the main frame using the `forMainFrameOnly` property (iOS only), and a set of matching rules for the allowed origins (Android only).

:::caution Note for Android
  Unfortunately, on Android, when using `UserScriptInjectionTime.AT_DOCUMENT_START`, if the `WebViewFeature.DOCUMENT_START_SCRIPT` is not supported, there is no guarantee that the JavaScript code has been injected before other resources are loaded because the corresponding native class/feature doesn't exist, so InAppWebView tries to inject that `UserScript` as soon as possible.
:::

To add a `UserScript` to a WebView, you can use the `WebView.initialUserScripts` property:
```dart
InAppWebView(
  initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: WebUri('https://flutter.dev')),
  initialUserScripts: UnmodifiableListView<UserScript>([
    UserScript(
        source: "var foo = 49;",
        injectionTime: UserScriptInjectionTime.AT_DOCUMENT_START),
    UserScript(
        source: "var bar = 2;",
        injectionTime: UserScriptInjectionTime.AT_DOCUMENT_END),
  ]),
  onLoadStop: (controller, url) async {
    var result = await controller.evaluateJavascript(source: "foo + bar");
    print(result); // 51
  },
),
```

To add or remove User Scripts, you can also use the corresponding methods, such as `InAppWebViewController.addUserScript`, `InAppWebViewController.removeUserScript`, etc.

:::info
  Adding or removing User Scripts at runtime after a web page is loaded will take no effect until the next web page load.
:::

For each `UserScript` you can define a `groupName` that you can use, for example, to remove a group of User Scripts with the `InAppWebViewController.removeUserScriptsByGroupName` method.

### Security

For each `UserScript`, you can restrict execution using the `allowedOriginRules` and `forMainFrameOnly` parameters.
`allowedOriginRules` represents a set of matching rules for the allowed origins.

:::info
    Adding `'*'` as an allowed origin or setting this to `null`, it means it will allow every origin.
    Instead, an empty `Set` will block every origin.

    **NOTE for Android**: each origin pattern MUST follow the table rule of `PlatformInAppWebViewController.addWebMessageListener`.

    **NOTE for iOS, macOS, Windows**: each origin pattern will be used as a Regular Expression Pattern that will be used on JavaScript side using [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp).
:::

`forMainFrameOnly` is a boolean value that indicates whether to inject the script into the main frame.
Specify `true` to inject the script only into the main frame, or `false` to inject it into all frames.
The default value is `true`.

Starting from plugin version >= `6.2.0-beta.1`, you can restrict also internal User Scripts (PluginScript) execution
using `InAppWebViewSettings.pluginScriptsForMainFrameOnly` and `InAppWebViewSettings.pluginScriptsOriginAllowList`.

They work the same way as `UserScript.forMainFrameOnly` and `UserScript.allowedOriginRules` parameters,
but they will apply for **all** the internal User Scripts.
Also, they should be set when initializing the WebView through `PlatformWebViewCreationParams.initialSettings` parameter,
as setting or changing these values after the WebView has been created won't have any effect.

Both settings apply also to the **JavaScript Bridge** object, which is initialized using an internal User Script.
If no `InAppWebViewSettings.javaScriptBridgeForMainFrameOnly` and/or `InAppWebViewSettings.javaScriptBridgeOriginAllowList` are set,
then these settings will be used respectively.

The default value for `InAppWebViewSettings.pluginScriptsForMainFrameOnly` is `false`.

The default value for `InAppWebViewSettings.pluginScriptsOriginAllowList` is `null`.
