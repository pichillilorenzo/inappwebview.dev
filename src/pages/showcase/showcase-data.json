We use the same protocols Ente Photos uses to encrypt and preserve your data.\n\nMULTI DEVICE SYNC\nAuth will automatically sync the 2FA tokens you add to your account, across all your devices. Every new device you sign into will have access to these tokens.\n\nWEB ACCESS\nYou can access your 2FA tokens on any device by using https://auth.ente.io.\n\nOFFLINE MODE\nAuth generates 2FA tokens offline, so your network connectivity will not get in the way of your workflow.\n\nIMPORT AND EXPORT\nYou can add tokens to ente by one of the following methods:\n- Scanning a QR code\n- Manually entering (copy-pasting) a 2FA secret\n- Bulk importing from a file that contains a list of codes in the following format:\n\notpauth://totp/provider.com:you@email.com?secret=YOUR_SECRET\n\nThe codes maybe separated by new lines or commas.\n\nYou can also export the codes you have added to ente, to an unencrypted text file, that adheres to the above format.\n\nTERMS\nhttps://ente.io/terms",
