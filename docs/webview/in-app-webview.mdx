# InAppWebView

`InAppWebView` is a Flutter Widget for adding an **inline native WebView** integrated into the flutter widget tree.

The plugin relies on Flutter's mechanism for embedding Android and iOS native views: [AndroidView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AndroidView-class.html) and [UiKitView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/UiKitView-class.html).
Known issues are tagged with the [platform-views](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/a%3A%20platform-views) label in the [Flutter official repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).

On Web platform, the WebView is embedded using the [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) HTML element.

:::caution Web platform limitation
Because of the nature of the [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), the Web platform has a lot of limitations regarding WebView control.
Most of the `InAppWebViewController` methods are impossible to be implemented, and the ones that are, require the iframe to have the same origin of the website.

Check the documentation of each specific method you want to use to understand if it is supported or not.
:::

## Basic Usage

:::caution
  It requires *Android API 20+* (see [AndroidView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AndroidView-class.html)) or *Android API 19+* if you set the `useHybridComposition: true` Android-specific option.
:::

`InAppWebViewSettings` provides access to a variety of settings that you might find useful.
For example, if you're developing a web application that's designed specifically for the WebView in your app,
then you can define a custom user agent string with `InAppWebViewSettings.userAgent`,
then query the custom user agent in your web page to verify that the client requesting your web page is actually your app.

Instead, use `InAppWebViewController` to control the WebView instance.

Example:
```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_inappwebview/flutter_inappwebview.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

Future main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  if (!kIsWeb && defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
    await InAppWebViewController.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
  }

  runApp(MaterialApp(home: new MyApp()));
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => new _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final GlobalKey webViewKey = GlobalKey();

  InAppWebViewController? webViewController;
  InAppWebViewSettings settings = InAppWebViewSettings(
      useShouldOverrideUrlLoading: true,
      mediaPlaybackRequiresUserGesture: false,
      allowsInlineMediaPlayback: true,
      iframeAllow: "camera; microphone",
      iframeAllowFullscreen: true
  );

  PullToRefreshController? pullToRefreshController;
  String url = "";
  double progress = 0;
  final urlController = TextEditingController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    pullToRefreshController = kIsWeb ? null : PullToRefreshController(
      settings: PullToRefreshSettings(
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
      onRefresh: () async {
        if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android) {
          webViewController?.reload();
        } else if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.iOS) {
          webViewController?.loadUrl(
              urlRequest: URLRequest(url: await webViewController?.getUrl()));

## Use JavaScript in WebView

JavaScript support is enabled by default. To disable it, set `InAppWebViewSettings.javaScriptEnabled` to `false`.

In general, calling methods that evaluates javascript code (such as `evaluateJavascript`)
too early (for example inside `onWebViewCreated` or `onLoadStart` events), won't work
because the WebView is not ready to handle it yet.

Instead, you should call these methods, for example, inside the `onLoadStop` event or in any other events
where you know the page is ready "enough".

Check [JavaScript](/docs/category/javascript) docs for more details.

## Handle page navigation

The basic navigation events are `onLoadStart` and on `onLoadStop`.
Also, the `onPageCommitVisible` event is fired when the web view begins to receive web content.

:::caution
The `onLoadStop` event could be called multiple times.
That's platform-specific, and it's related on how the native platform implements the WebView!
:::

The `onLoadStart` and `onLoadStop` events are not called when the navigation state of the `WebView` changes through the usage of javascript,
without a complete reload of the web page.

To detect these cases, use the `onUpdateVisitedHistory` event, that is an event fired when the host application updates its visited links database or
when the navigation state of the `WebView` changes through the usage of
javascript **[History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)** functions (`pushState()`, `replaceState()`) and `onpopstate` event
or, also, when the javascript `window.location` changes without reloading the webview (for example appending or modifying a hash to the url).

Instead, to detect HTTP errors or loading errors, use `onReceivedHttpError` or `onReceivedError` respectively.

To cancel or allow the navigation requests, you should use the navigation event `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`,
which gives the host application a chance to take control when a URL is about to be loaded in the current WebView using `NavigationActionPolicy`.
To be able to listen this event, you **must** set `InAppWebViewSettings.useShouldOverrideUrlLoading` to `true`.

:::info `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` NOTE for Android
Note that on Android there isn't any way to load an URL for a frame that is not the main frame,
so if the request is not for the main frame, the navigation is allowed by default.
However, if you want to cancel requests for subframes, you can use the `InAppWebViewSettings.regexToCancelSubFramesLoading` setting
to write a Regular Expression that, if the url request of a subframe matches, then the request of that subframe is canceled.

Also, on Android, this event is not called for POST requests.
:::

On Android, you can also use the `shouldInterceptRequest` event, that is an event that
notifies the host application of a resource request and allow the application to return the data.
If the return value is `null`, the WebView will continue to load the resource as usual.
Otherwise, the return response and data will be used.
To be able to listen this event, you **must** set `InAppWebViewSettings.useShouldInterceptRequest` to `true`.

This event is invoked for a variety of URL schemes (e.g., `http(s):`, `data:`, `file:`, etc.),
not only those schemes which send requests over the network.
This is not called for `javascript:` URLs, `blob:` URLs, or for assets accessed via `file:///android_asset/` or `file:///android_res/` URLs.

In the case of redirects, this is only called for the initial resource URL, not any subsequent redirect URLs.

## Handle custom URLs

WebView applies restrictions when requesting resources and resolving links that use a custom URL scheme.
For example, if you implement events such as `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` or `shouldInterceptRequest`, then WebView invokes them only for valid URLs.

For example, WebView may not call your `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` event for links like this:

```html
<a href="showProfile">Show Profile</a>
```

Invalid URLs like above are handled inconsistently in WebView,
so we recommend using a well-formed URL instead,
such as using a custom scheme or using an HTTPS URL for a domain that your organization controls.

Instead of using a simple string in a link as shown earlier, you can use a custom scheme such as the following:

```html
<a href="example-app:showProfile">Show Profile</a>
```

You can then handle this URL in your `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` event like this:

```dart
static final String APP_SCHEME = "example-app:";
// ...
InAppWebView(
  initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(
    useShouldOverrideUrlLoading: true
  ),
  shouldOverrideUrlLoading: (controller, navigationAction) async {
    final uri = navigationAction.request.url;
    if (uri != null && uri.toString().startsWith(APP_SCHEME)) {
      // do whatever you want and cancel the request.
      return NavigationActionPolicy.CANCEL;
    }
    return NavigationActionPolicy.ALLOW;
  },
)
```

The `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` API is primarily intended for launching intents for specific URLs.
When implementing it, make sure to return `NavigationActionPolicy.ALLOW` for URLs the WebView should handle.
You're not limited to launching intents, though; you can replace launching intents with any custom behavior in the preceding code samples.

### Handle custom schemes

Instead, if you want to handle custom schemes and return a custom response for that specific request,
you can use the `onLoadResourceWithCustomScheme` event.
With that event, you can handle the url request and return a `CustomSchemeResponse` to load a specific resource encoded to `base64`.

To register the list of custom schemes you want to capture, set the `InAppWebViewSettings.resourceCustomSchemes` with a list of string values.

Example:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
//...
InAppWebView(
  initialUrlRequest: URLRequest(url: WebUri('https://example.com')),
  initialSettings: InAppWebViewSettings(resourceCustomSchemes: ["my-special-custom-scheme"]),
  onLoadResourceWithCustomScheme: (controller, request) async {
    if (request.url.scheme == "my-special-custom-scheme") {
      var bytes = await rootBundle.load("assets/" +
          request.url
              .toString()
              .replaceFirst("my-special-custom-scheme://", "", 0));
      var response = CustomSchemeResponse(
          data: bytes.buffer.asUint8List(),
          contentType: "image/svg+xml",
          contentEncoding: "utf-8");
      return response;
    }
    return null;
  },
)
```

## Navigate web page history

When your WebView overrides URL loading, it automatically accumulates a history of visited web pages.
You can navigate backward and forward through the history with
`InAppWebViewController.goBack()`, `InAppWebViewController.goForward()`, and `InAppWebViewController.goBackOrForward()`.

The `InAppWebViewController.canGoBack()` method returns true if there is actually web page history for the user to visit.
Likewise, you can use `InAppWebViewController.canGoForward()` to check whether there is a forward history.
If you don't perform this check, then once the user reaches the end of the history,
`InAppWebViewController.goBack()`, `InAppWebViewController.goForward()`, or `InAppWebViewController.goBackOrForward()` does nothing.

To get the WebView history, use the `InAppWebViewController.getCopyBackForwardList` method, which returns the list of visited URLs and titles during the current session.

## Manage windows

By default, requests to open new windows are ignored.
This is true whether they are opened by JavaScript or by the target attribute in a link.
You can customize this behaviour implementing `onCreateWindow` event.

:::info
To allow JavaScript to open windows, you need to set `InAppWebViewSettings.javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically` setting to `true`.
:::

:::info NOTE for Android
You need to set `InAppWebViewSettings.supportMultipleWindows` setting to `true`.
:::

:::caution
To keep your app more secure, it's best to prevent popups and new windows from opening.
The safest way to implement this behavior is to set `InAppWebViewSettings.supportMultipleWindows` setting to `true`
but not implement `onCreateWindow` or simply return `false`.
Note that this logic prevents any page that uses `target="_blank"` in its links from loading.
:::

Instead, to detect when a WebView or a window should be closed and removed from the view system,
you should implement the `onCloseWindow` event.
At this point, WebCore has stopped any loading in this window and has removed any cross-scripting ability in javascript.

Use the `onWindowFocus` and `onWindowBlur` events to detect when a WebView has received or lost focus respectively.

## Load local content

You can provide web-based content—such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS—for your app to use that you
statically compile into the application rather than fetch over the internet.

In-app content doesn't require internet access or consume a user's bandwidth, and if the content is
designed specifically for WebView-only—that is, it depends on communicating with a native
app—then users can't accidentally load it in a web browser.

However, there are some drawbacks to in-app content. Updating web-based content requires shipping a new app update,
and there is the possibility of mismatched content between what's on a web site and what's in the app
on your device if users have outdated app versions.

### Android WebView Asset Loader
On Android, you can use `WebViewAssetLoader`, that is a flexible and performant way to load in-app content in a WebView object.
This class supports:

- Loading content with an HTTP(S) URL for compatibility with the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).
- Loading subresources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and iframes.

Check [WebView Asset Loader](/docs/webview/webview-asset-loader) docs for more details

### In-App Localhost Server

The `InAppLocalhostServer` allows you to create a simple server on `http://localhost:[port]/`
in order to be able to load your assets file on a local server.

Check [In-App Localhost Server](/docs/in-app-localhost-server) docs for more details

### loadData

When your app only needs to load an HTML page and doesn't need to intercept subresources,
consider using `loadData()`, which doesn't require application assets.
You can use it as shown in the following code sample:

```dart
final html = """<html><body><p>Hello world</p></body></html>""";
final baseUrl = WebUri("https://example.com/");

webViewController.loadData(data: html, baseUrl: baseUrl, historyUrl: baseUrl);
```

Choose argument values carefully:

- `baseUrl`: This is the URL your HTML content will be loaded as. This must be an HTTP(S) URL.
- `data`: This is the HTML content you want to display, as a string.
- `mimeType`: The default value is `text/html`.
- `encoding`: The default value is `utf8`. On Android, this is unused when baseUrl is an HTTP(S) URL.
- `historyUrl`: available only on Android. It represents the URL to use as the history entry.
- `allowingReadAccessTo`: available only on iOS. Used in combination with baseUrl (using the `file://` scheme),
it represents the URL from which to read the web content.

It is strongly recommend using an HTTP(S) URL as the `baseUrl`, as this ensures your app complies with the same-origin policy.

### Antipatterns

There are several other ways to load in-app content, but we strongly recommend against them:

- `file://` URLs and `data:` URLs are considered to be opaque origins, meaning that they can't take advantage of
powerful web APIs such as [fetch()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) or
[XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

- Although `InAppWebViewSettings.allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `InAppWebViewSettings.allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`
can work around the issues with `file://` URLs, it is recommend against setting these to `true` because
it leaves your app vulnerable to file-based exploits.
It is recommend explicitly setting these to false on all API levels for the strongest security.

- For the same reasons, it is recommend against `file://android_assets/` and `file://android_res/` URLs.
The WebView Asset Loader `AssetsPathHandler` and `ResourcesPathHandler` classes are meant to be drop-in replacements.

- Avoid using `MixedContentMode.MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW`. This setting generally is not necessary and weakens the security of your app.
It is recommend loading your in-app content over the same scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) as your website's resources and using either
`MixedContentMode.MIXED_CONTENT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` or `MixedContentMode.MIXED_CONTENT_NEVER_ALLOW`, as appropriate.
