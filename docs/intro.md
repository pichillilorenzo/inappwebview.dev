# Getting Started

## What is a WebView? Differences between a WebView and a Browser

Before we get started, we should talk about the differences between a WebView and a Browser.

A WebView is a tool that allows you to display web content within a mobile or desktop application. 
However, it is not a full browser. This means that many advanced browser features 
(such as managing multiple tabs, extensions, advanced security features, developer tools, etc.) 
may not be available or will need to be manually implemented.

If you wish to create an app that behaves like a browser, it is possible to do so using WebViews, 
but keep in mind that there will be limitations depending on the platform (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.). 
Each operating system has rules and restrictions that might affect your implementation. 
For example, advanced features such as file system access or handling custom HTTPS certificates may require additional configurations.

A WebView is primarily designed to embed web content into native apps, rather than providing a complete browsing experience like a full browser. 
If your project requires browser-like functionality, it's important to be aware of these differences and the potential challenges.

Here you can find a Browser example implemented using this plugin: https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_browser_app

Let's get started now!

## Installation

Add `flutter_inappwebview` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

If you're running an application and need to access the binary messenger before `runApp()` has been called (for example, during plugin initialization), then you need to explicitly call the `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` first.

An example:
```dart
void main() {
  // it should be the first line in main method
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // rest of your app code
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Requirements

- Dart sdk: "^3.5.0"
- Flutter: ">=3.24.0"
- Android: `minSdkVersion >= 19`, `compileSdk >= 34`, [AGP](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin) version `>= 7.3.0` (use [Android Studio - Android Gradle plugin Upgrade Assistant](https://developer.android.com/build/agp-upgrade-assistant) for help), support for `androidx` (see [AndroidX Migration](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration) to migrate an existing app)
- iOS 12.0+: `--ios-language swift`, Xcode version `>= 15.0`
- MacOS 10.14+: Xcode version `>= 15.0`

## Native WebView implementation

These are the native WebView classes used by the plugin to implement its features:
- Android: [android.webkit.WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView)
- iOS: [WebKit\/WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)
- macOS: [WebKit\/WKWebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview)
- Windows: [Microsoft.Web.WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- Web: [HTMLIFrameElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement)

:::info
Since each platform has its own native implementation, keep in mind that in some cases they may behave differently.

## Setup Android

If you are starting a new fresh app, you need to create the Flutter App with `flutter create --androidx -i swift` to add support for `androidx`, otherwise it won't work (see [AndroidX Migration](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration) to migrate an existing app).

During the build, if Android fails with `Error: uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 16 cannot be smaller than version 19 declared in library`, it means that you need to update the `minSdkVersion` of your `android/app/build.gradle` file to at least `19`.

Also, you need to add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>` in the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file in order to give minimum permission to perform network operations in your application.

If you `flutter create`d your project prior to version `1.12`, you need to make sure to update your project in order to use the new **Java Embedding API**! Take a look at the official Flutter wiki: [Upgrading pre 1.12 Android projects](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects). Also, you can refer to the [#343](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_inappwebview/issues/343) issue.

Remember to add `<meta-data>` tag inside the `<application>` tag of your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<meta-data
  android:name="flutterEmbedding"
  android:value="2" />
```
as mentioned in the 6th step of [Full-Flutter app migration](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects#full-flutter-app-migration) guide. **Without this, the plugin will NOT work!!!**

Also, note that to use the `InAppWebView` widget on Android, it requires **Android API 20+** (see [AndroidView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/AndroidView-class.html)) or **Android API 19+** if you enable the `useHybridComposition` Android-specific option.

### Support HTTP (non-HTTPS) request
Starting with Android 9 (API level 28), cleartext support is disabled by default:
- Check the official [Network security configuration - "Opt out of cleartext traffic"](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config#CleartextTrafficPermitted) section.
- Also, check this StackOverflow issue answer: [Cleartext HTTP traffic not permitted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50834600/4637638).

### ChromeSafariBrowser on Android 11+
If you want to use the `ChromeSafariBrowser` class on Android 11+ you need to specify your app querying for `android.support.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (you can read more about it here: https://developers.google.com/web/android/custom-tabs/best-practices#applications_targeting_android_11_api_level_30_or_above).

### Enable Material Components for Android
To use Material Components when the user interacts with input elements in the WebView, follow the steps described in the [Enabling Material Components instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#enabling-material-components).

## Setup iOS

If you are starting a new fresh app, you need to create the Flutter App with `flutter create --androidx -i swift` (see [flutter/flutter#13422 (comment)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13422#issuecomment-392133780)), otherwise, you will get this message:
```
=== BUILD TARGET flutter_inappwebview OF PROJECT Pods WITH CONFIGURATION Debug ===
The "Swift Language Version" (SWIFT_VERSION) build setting must be set to a supported value for targets which use Swift. Supported values are: 3.0, 4.0, 4.2, 5.0. This setting can be set in the build settings editor.
```

If you still have this problem, try to edit iOS `Podfile` like this (see [#15](https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/flutter_inappwebview/issues/15)):
```
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!  # required by simple_permission
  ...
end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '5.0'  # required by simple_permission
      config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
    end
  end
end
```

Instead, if you have already a non-swift project, you can check this issue to solve the problem: [Friction adding swift plugin to objective-c project](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16049).

### Support HTTP (non-HTTPS) request
You need to disable Apple Transport Security (ATS) feature. There're two options:
* Disable ATS for a specific domain only ([Official wiki](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsexceptiondomains)): (add following codes to your `Info.plist` file)
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
  <dict>
    <key>www.yourserver.com</key>
    <dict>
      <!-- add this key to enable subdomains such as sub.yourserver.com -->
      <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
      <true/>
      <!-- add this key to allow standard HTTP requests, thus negating the ATS -->
      <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
      <true/>
      <!-- add this key to specify the minimum TLS version to accept -->
      <key>NSTemporaryExceptionMinimumTLSVersion</key>
      <string>TLSv1.1</string>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</dict>
```
* Completely disable ATS ([Official wiki](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloads)): (add following codes to your `Info.plist` file)
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/>
</dict>
```

Other useful `Info.plist` properties are:
* `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`: A Boolean value indicating whether to allow loading of local resources ([Official wiki](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowslocalnetworking));
* `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent`: A Boolean value indicating whether all App Transport Security restrictions are disabled for requests made from web views ([Official wiki](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloadsinwebcontent)).

## Setup MacOS

To be able to make HTTP requests, you need to configure the macOS App Sandbox by enabling the `Outgoing Connections (Client)` option in your MacOS XCode Project, under `Runner > Signing & Capabilities`.

Here is an example of configuration:

![MacOS App Sandbox example](./intro/macos_app_sandbox_example.png "MacOS App Sandbox example.")

For more details, check the [Apple Official Guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-the-macos-app-sandbox/).

## Setup Windows

To be able to build on Windows, you must have the `nuget` CLI tool available on your Windows environment.

Follow the instructions here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools?tabs=windows#nugetexe-cli

Add the folder location for the `nuget.exe` file to your Windows `PATH` environment variable.

## Setup Web

To make it work properly on the Web platform, you need to add the `web_support.js` file inside the `<head>` of your `web/index.html` file:

```html
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
    <script type="application/javascript" src="/assets/packages/flutter_inappwebview_web/assets/web/web_support.js" defer></script>
  <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

:::info Flutter widgets over iframe are not working!
When overlaying Flutter widgets on top of `HtmlElementView` widgets that respond to mouse gestures (handle clicks, for example), the clicks will be consumed by the `HtmlElementView`, and not relayed to Flutter.

The result is that Flutter widget's `onTap` (and other) handlers won't fire as expected, but they'll affect the underlying webview.

This is an issue of Flutter itself and not of this plugin.

To overcome this problem, you should use the official [pointer_interceptor](https://pub.dev/packages/pointer_interceptor) Flutter plugin. Check the `pointer_interceptor` plugin docs to understand how to use it.
:::

## Load files inside the assets folder

To be able to make visible your local asset files (images, javascript, css, etc.) to Flutter, you need to add them in the `assets` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file, otherwise they cannot be found.
Read the official Flutter documentation [Adding assets and images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images) for more details.

Example of a `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
...

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  assets:
    - assets/index.html
    - assets/css/
    - assets/images/

...
```

## Enable camera for HTML inputs

In order to be able to use camera, for example, for taking images through `<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture>` HTML tag, you need to ask camera permission. If you need to capture video and audio, you need to ask also microphone permission.
To ask permissions, for example, you can use the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) plugin!

Code example:
```dart
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart';

Future main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Permission.camera.request();
  await Permission.microphone.request(); // if you need microphone permission

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Configure Android
On Android, you need to add these permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file to be able to use camera for taking images and videos:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIDEO_CAPTURE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.AUDIO_CAPTURE" />
```

Also, you need to add the following code inside the `<application>` tag of your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
<provider
    android:name="com.pichillilorenzo.flutter_inappwebview_android.InAppWebViewFileProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.flutter_inappwebview_android.fileprovider"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" />
</provider>
```

### Configure iOS
On iOS, you need to add the following properties in your `Info.plist` file to be able to use camera for taking images and videos:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Flutter requires access to microphone.</string>

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Flutter requires access to camera.</string>
```
If you open this file In Xcode, then the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` property is represented by `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description` and `NSCameraUsageDescription` is represented by `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`.
